Handwritten Digit Recognition

This project centers around image processing, focusing on the development of a model specifically designed to recognize and classify handwritten digits. The system employs cutting-edge machine learning techniques to analyze digit images and accurately classify them. The model utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to extract and process features from the input images.

The model is trained on the MNIST dataset, a widely used benchmark for handwritten digit recognition. This dataset serves as a strong foundation for testing the model's performance and ensuring its ability to accurately classify digit images.

Technologies Used:

Python
Numpy
TensorFlow
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for model architecture
